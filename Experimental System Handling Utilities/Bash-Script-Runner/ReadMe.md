This script provides a class-based approach to execute Bash scripts from within a Python environment. It allows users to run Bash scripts and capture their standard output, standard error, and return codes. Advanced error handling and exception handling have been implemented to ensure robustness.

### Features
- Executes Bash scripts from Python code.
- Captures standard output, standard error, and return codes of the executed Bash script.
- Implements advanced error handling for various scenarios.

### Usage
To use this script, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Set Up Your Bash Script:**
    - Place your Bash script (`your_script.sh`) in the same directory as the Python script.

2. **Run the Script:**
    - Customize the `input_data` variable with your input for the Bash script.
    - Execute the Python script using the Python interpreter:
    ```
    python bash_script_runner.py
    ```

3. **View the Output:**
    - The script will display the standard output, standard error, and return code of the Bash script.

### Example
```
# Run the script
python bash_script_runner.py
```
